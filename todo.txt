Enhancements:
*Created the EAC3ToCommonRulesValidatorService to centralize common eac3to validation rules that many of the backend services use.  Validation code was duplicated and increased the application's technical debt
*When the user chooses Directory Per Episode for encoding or they are not remuxing for a movie, the folder names eac3to will use has been changed from e## to episode##
*When the user chooses Directory Per Episode for remuxing movie(s), the folder names eac3to will use is movie##
*Text updated in all BatchGuy Screens to replace "e##" with "episode##"
*Updated Github Wiki screenshots to reflect eac3to extract folder change to "episode##" when the user chooses Directory Per Episode
*Settings Screen doesn't close when the user selects the save menu item
*Is Remux for Movie Checkbox added to the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
*When users select Is Remux for Movie Checkbox:
-Season Number is disabled on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-User must enter Remux information for each playlist on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-Label text for "Series" name changes to "Movie" name on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-eac3to output directory text changes from "episode##" to "movie##"
-Episode Name is disabled on the BluRay Title Info Screen
-Episode Number text is changed to "Movie #" on the BluRay Title Info Screen
*BatchGuy now has the concept of "movie" mode.  When users choose to remux for a movie:
-Each playlist will be treated like a seperate movie
-Each playlist will have their own Remux Template
-When the user extracts the Blu-ray artifacts, if they choose "Directory Per Episode", each movie will be in a folder called "movie##"
-Movies will not have an episode number or episode name
-Movie names must be unqiue
*BatchGuy now has over 150 Unit Tests
*Directory Per Episode text has been changed to Directory Per Playlist


*Change episode## to movie## on the usercontrol, this may be hard also update the the 2 screenshots of the eac3to screen after you do this


Misc
-Directory Per Episode, change to Directory Per Playlist on documentation
-tell encode tools user of the changes


Notes: 
*Old eac3toSettings don't work
*Handles 2 in 1
*You can remux a bunch of movies at one time
*New wiki


--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen



*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
