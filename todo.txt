*Created BluRayTitleInfoDefaultSettingsService to centralize the blu-ray default settings logic
*Created new service to centralize mkvmerge default logic to make it more unit testable and easier to modify
*Users can now select a mkvmerge compression muxing mode on the BluRay Title Info Screen
*Users can select a subtitle language that is always selected and what the mkvmerge default track flag should be




--possible nice to haves
Default audio:
	This will be on the eac3to screen because it per blu-ray

1) checkbox and a dropdown, maybe a button and maybe a audio type too for main and commentary, go ahead with button so user can explicitly state they want the change and maybe prompt if you are overwritting
	*all non-null title info audio defaults will be set
	*when new title info created, set the default

[request]
refering to the last additions of default tracks, would it also be possible to select which tracks (audio & subtitles) should be ticked by default? refering to audio quality and language.

e.g. Id always want to have the english lossless audio track ticked by default when I jump into a playlist (without the -core or ac3 demux option ticked) as well as only the english subtitles (could be further differentiated between forced only or full english if there is a separate track for forced subs). I dont want to have to tick off all other subtitles files for each playlist.

would it be possible to add this?

*Unselect all on Blu-ray Title Info Screen
	http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen

*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)
*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav
*On Blu-ray Title Info Screen, instead of auto-sorting by langage, just always put eng at the top
*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
