--todo
*BluRayTitleParserService service now uses the MKVMergeLanguageService to determine the blu-ray item language
*To temporarily handle Playlists with multiple videos, the application chooses the first video it finds
*Correct a misspelling of a word in an error message

*look at summary.episodenumber and not summary.bluraytitleinfo.episodenumber
-test when selected but no episode number entered
-for number of episodes, go by selected and episode number not null

*maybe start overwritting files

add checkbox to ignore internal subs when muxing for encode
-create new flag EAC3ToConfiguration.IgnoreInternalSubtitles
-MKVMergeOutputService.GetSubtitlePart(), add logic here to check this flag and act accordingly
-MKVMergeOutputService.GetTrackOrderPart(), add logic here to check this flag to get the correct count
-On eac3to screen, always set this flag to false
-On x264 screen, checkbox defaulted to checked and tied to this new flag




--possible nice to haves
ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
-http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
