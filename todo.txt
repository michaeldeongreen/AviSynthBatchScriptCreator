*Automatically sort the AviSynth Grid by AviSynth File Name when users add (.avs) files to the grid
*Every time a user chooses to create a batch file, check to see if it exists, if so, delete it.  Right now, the application will just append lines to an existing batch file, which is kind of annoying
*Look into the user request below:
-I just thought of a new feature that shouldn't be too hard to implement if you get a chance. It'd be nice to be able to output a batch for creating ffvideosource indexes, maybe at the same time as avisynth creation. Probably not something everyone does but it makes loading avs files quicker once I start working on them. Syntax is very simple, it's just X:\Path\to\ffmsindex.exe "X:\Path\to\input.mkv". The standard path is "C:\Program Files (x86)\AviSynth\plugins\ffmsindex.exe" but I guess you could add it to the settings dialogue to tell BatchGuy where it is along with eac3to.exe, vfw2x264.exe, etc.



--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
