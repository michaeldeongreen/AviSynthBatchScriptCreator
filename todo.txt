Enhancements:
*Menu on the Main Screen is now disabled if there was an error trying to load the settings file
*Check for new BatchGuy Versions checkbox added to the BatchGuy Settings Screen. 
*If the user has checked "Check for New BatchGuy Versions" on the Settings Screen, BatchGuy will check to see if new versions of BatchGuy have been released and will display a "new" picture icon on the upper right corner of the Main Screen.  The user can click the icon to navigate to the latest release page and download the latest version.
*Warning text under the "Is this Remux for a Movie" checkbox on is now red and the caption was modified

DTS is a confusing option, is it express, is it master audio?  Remove it from ALL drop down boxes.  Settings Grid (Audio Output) and BluRay Title Info. In Default Settings Service, remove setting dtsma to dts and -core, just keep -core, it is valid per sk and test

*Introduce Lossless in the settings audio drop down
*Put red warning on mkvtoolnix options to make sure row selected like on eac3to

*Add DTS Express and distinguish between it and dts ma in parser
*During title line item processing, create new method for determining if lossless or lossy and add new property to BluRayAudio Class maybe IsLossless.  Once this is done, use this flag instead of what you have now for lossless checked or not
-Lossy
5: AC3, Czech, 5.1 channels, 384kbps, 48kHz
12: DTS Express, English, 2.0 channels, 192kbps, 48kHz

-Lossless
*4: DTS Master Audio, English, 5.1 channels, 24 bits, 48kHz
*3: RAW/PCM, English, 2.0 channels, 24 bits, 48kHz
*4: TrueHD/AC3 (Atmos), English, 7.1 channels, 48kHz

--possible nice to haves
*Think about tackling the multiple vidoes in a single playlist (labyrinth)
*Think about an exe folder that has all the exes in it already by default/would need to update in the app though

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*Ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
