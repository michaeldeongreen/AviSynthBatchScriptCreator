Enhancements:
*Menu on the Main Screen is now disabled if there was an error trying to load the settings file
*Check for new BatchGuy Versions checkbox added to the BatchGuy Settings Screen. 
*If the user has checked "Check for New BatchGuy Versions" on the Settings Screen, BatchGuy will check to see if new versions of BatchGuy have been released and will display a "new" picture icon on the upper right corner of the Main Screen.

*Warning text under the "Is this Remux for a Movie" checkbox on is now red and the caption was modified

*Introduce Lossless in the settings audio drop down
*Put red warning on mkvtoolnix options to make sure row selected like on eac3to

--possible nice to haves
*Think about tackling the multiple vidoes in a single playlist (labyrinth)
*Think about an exe folder that has all the exes in it already by default/would need to update in the app though

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
