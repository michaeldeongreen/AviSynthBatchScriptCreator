--1.7 todo
*User receives error message if encode names on create x264 batch file screen don't have (.mkv) extension
*User receives error message if encode names on create x264 batch file screen are not unique
*Fixed bug where x264 template script text was not being trimmed for spaces and causing problems with the x264 batch file


*look into the grid column size of encode name on x264.  when you copy a long text, it should put it all on there, not just the first line when there is a break
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*ability to save/load eac3to batch guy data

[couldn't reproduce]
*Bug where you can't close title info screen because episode required even though nothing is chosen.  Button works but not the x at the top





--upcoming
*Maybe keep track of the Blu-ray folder directory, so you will open up the same directory every time
*find where you have number of files hardcoded to 99 and put the real value in it
*look into why the busy mouse indicator doesn't seem to work
*put the bluray title on the title info page
