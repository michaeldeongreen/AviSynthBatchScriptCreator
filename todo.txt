*mkvmerge for encodes
*avisynth doesn't close after done
*mkvmerge info always enabled on both screens
*x264 doesn't close after done
*cannot load a settings file created for remuxing

*Old eac3to files will not work

Front End (EAC3ToConfiguration has an Extension Method that tells the number of episodes, you can use this for the drop down box column):
	1) Besides the logic for Episode Name, remove checks for IsRemux on BluRay Title Info Screen, so encode mode can access mkvmerge controls -done
	2) Load and maybe Save (.batchGuyEac3toSettings) on x264 Screen -done
	3) Disable controls until it is loaded -done
	4) Add new property called episode number on X264File Model -done
	5) Add new drop down for X264File.EpisodeNumber (string) and make it a drop down and figure out how to load with the number of episodes -done
	*6) When they try to make the mkvmerge file, validate that all episodes mapped and all unique -done
	*7) Before saving, shove the filepath/name of encode into the bluraysummary.titleinfo.episodename based on the episode number drop down -done
	8) Enable mkvmerge section on eac3to screen -done

Back End:
	1) Create new MKVMerge\Services\MKVMergeBatchFileWriteForEncodeService and inherit from IMKVMergeBatchFileWriteService -done
	2) Looks like the constructor will need the X264File list and X264FileSettings -done
	3) For MKVMergeBatchFileWriteForEncodeService.IsValid, here you can check to see if all X264Files.EpisodeNumber has a value and they are unique or let #6 on Front End do it -done
	4) Make a private method to do #7 on Front End or maybe let the Front End do it -done
	5) Make EAC3ToConfiguration.IsVideoNameForMkvMerge -done
	6) EncodeTemplate1EAC3ToOutputNamingService.GetVideoName, use EAC3ToConfiguration.IsVideoNameForMkvMerge to determine hardcoded name or episode name, which will have bluraysummary.titleinfo.episodename -done


5) MAKE SURE SELECTED ON EAC3TO MATCHES THE GRID ON X264 COUNT
2) MIGHT WANT TO CLEAR SOME X264 INFO IF THEY GO BACK AND CHANGE STUFF ON EAC3TO
3) SEE IF THE EPISODE NAME SHOWS WHEN YOU SHOVE ENCODE NAME IN IT ON BLURAY TITLE INFO -it did, -done
1) DON'T FORGET TO WRITE CODE IN EAC3TO TO SAVE IFNO ENTERED ON OTHER SCREENS IN CASE THEY GO BACK AND FORTH -done
4) MAKE SURE THEY CANNOT LOAD A REMUX FILE -done
6) HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DELETE AVS FROM GRID -done

Clean Up:
X264FileSettings.X264EncodeAndLogFileOutputDirectoryPath and X264EncodeAndLogFileOutputDirectoryPathType not needed anymore, using it but get rid of it as eac3to settings has the info

AVSBatchSettings.VideoToEncodeDirectoryType,VideoToEncodeDirectory

--possible nice to haves
*On the Create x264 Batch File, add functionality load (.batchGuyEac3toSettings), so you can have the eac3to and mkvmerge info to create an mkvmerge batch file
-Either use If statement or create a new abstract class and move all current mkvmerge logic (except video) to a base class and have a remux/none-remux sub class
-Understand that you can re-use 99% of current mkvmerge service functionality, only with ecnoder mux, they supply you the video name, it isn't auto-created
-Enable mkvmerge section on BluRay Title Info Screen all the time
-Allow user to load the (.batchGuyEac3toSettings) on the Create x264 Batch File Screen
-Once (.batchGuyEac3toSettings), add a new drop down column to the grid that has the episode numbers, so they can be matched with the avs/encode name


*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
-http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
