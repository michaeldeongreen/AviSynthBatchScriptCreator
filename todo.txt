Enhancements:
*Menu on the Main Screen is now disabled if there was an error trying to load the settings file
*Check for new BatchGuy Versions checkbox added to the BatchGuy Settings Screen. 
*If the user has checked "Check for New BatchGuy Versions" on the Settings Screen, BatchGuy will check to see if new versions of BatchGuy have been released and will display a "new" picture icon on the upper right corner of the Main Screen.  The user can click the icon to navigate to the latest release page and download the latest version.
*Warning text under the "Is this Remux for a Movie" checkbox on is now red and the caption was modified
*DTS Audio has been removed in all BatchGuy Audio Type comboboxes.  Users will see DTS Express or DTSMA.  The DTS options was removed to make the application display more accurate information to the user.  It was especially confusing to see DTS and DTSMA items in the same combobox.
*DTS Express has been added to all appropriate BatchGuy Audio Type comboboxes
*eac3to Parser has been modified to be able to distinguish between DTS Express and DTS MA
*eac3to Parser has been modified to set the BluRayAudio IsLossless flag
*Added "Lossless" item to the Audio Language Always Selected Audio Type drop down on the BatchGuy Settings Screen.  When this option is chosen, all lossless audio that matches what the "Always" selected language will be selected by default on the BluRay Title Info Screen
*Increased the size of the Executables and BluRay Title Info Defaults Grids on the BatchGuy Settings Screen
*Added warning text to the MKVToolNixGUI Options on the BluRay Title Info Screen


Notes:
*Due to the DTS audio type being removed and the remaining Audio Type Enum values being re-numbered, the (.batchGuySettings) settings file created in previous versions will not work in this version of the software.

--possible nice to haves
*Think about tackling the multiple vidoes in a single playlist (labyrinth)
*Think about an exe folder that has all the exes in it already by default/would need to update in the app though

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*Ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting


(Make sure a audio/subtitle row is selected before entering mkvmerge information)
