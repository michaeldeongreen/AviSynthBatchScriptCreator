--todo
Enhancements:
*Created the EAC3ToCommonRulesValidatorService to centralize common eac3to validation rules that many of the backend services use.  Validation code was duplicated and increased the application's technical debt
*When the user chooses Directory Per Episode for encoding or they are not remuxing for a movie, the folder names eac3to will use has been changed from e## to episode##
*When the user chooses Directory Per Episode for remuxing movie(s), the folder names eac3to will use is movie##
*Text updated in all BatchGuy Screens to replace "e##" with "episode##"
*Updated Github Wiki screenshots to reflect eac3to extract folder change to "episode##" when the user chooses Directory Per Episode
*Settings Screen doesn't close when the user selects the save menu item
*Is Remux for Movie Checkbox added to the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
*When users select Is Remux for Movie Checkbox:
-Season Number is disabled on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-User must enter Remux information for each playlist on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-Label text for "Series" name changes to "Movie" name on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen


*Movie Mode 2 (probably too much work)
eac3to UI
-forced to use directory per episode *****don't think this is needed, validation will enforce all names to be unique
-IsScreenValid, only check if series name is entered if isremux and not for a movie, we will check this on the backend


Title Info UI
-Episode Name disabled
-Episode Number caption will change to Movie Number


Backend
*Create new eac3to write service, it has its own rules
-names have to be unique, especially for single folder mode
*Create new mkvmerge write service
-names have to be unique, especially for single folder mode
-override the common rules error messages that have "episode" in it and put "movies"
*New OutputNamingService


Misc
-Operator override or overried equals for the EAC3ToRemuxFileNameTemplate to check field by field to make sure all movie names unique
-Change existing remux wiki to how to remux tv
-add new wiki for movie
*Use the purge for single movie and beauty/the beast for 2 in 1 for guide

Notes: 
*Old eac3toSettings don't work
*Handles 2 in 1
*You can remux a bunch of movies at one time
*New wiki


--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen



*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
-http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
