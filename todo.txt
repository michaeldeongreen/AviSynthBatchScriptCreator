*Added new section on Settings Screen to configure defaults for BluRay Title Info Screen
*Users can now choose whether or not Subtitles are selected by default

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen
*the blu-ray title info window cannot be closed without specifying the episode number. maybe a bit annoying if you havent looked at that yet and just wanted to have an overview of all the stream tracks.
*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)
*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav
*On Blu-ray Title Info Screen, instead of auto-sorting by langage, just always put eng at the top
*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
