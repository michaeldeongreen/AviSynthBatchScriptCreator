--todo


*Fix audio in the system.  Some audio is what is on the Blu-Ray others are just what you can convert it too
*BluRayTitleParserService.GetAudioType DTS needs to be set to DTSMA during parsing
*EAC3ToOutputService.GetAudioExtension doesn't have LPCM and since nobody references this, delete it
*Settings Screen should only have:
	AC3
	TrueHD
	DTSMA
	LPCM



--possible nice to haves
*Unselect all on Blu-ray Title Info Screen
	http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen
*the blu-ray title info window cannot be closed without specifying the episode number. maybe a bit annoying if you havent looked at that yet and just wanted to have an overview of all the stream tracks.
*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)
*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav
*On Blu-ray Title Info Screen, instead of auto-sorting by langage, just always put eng at the top
*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
*TheTVDB.com integration
