Enhancements
*BluRayTitleParserService service now uses the shared MKVMergeLanguageService to determine the blu-ray audio and subtitle language.  This will make determining the correct audio and video language more accurate and not return "undetermined"
*To temporarily handle Playlists with multiple videos, the application chooses the first video it finds (multiple videos in a Playlist logic may never be implemented)
*Ignore Internal Subtitles Checkbox added to the Create x264 Batch File Screen.  When Encoders check this flag, only External Subtitles will be used when creating the mkvmerge batch file even if Internal Subtitles are selcted on the BluRay Title Info Screen.  With this feature, Encoders don't have to navigate to the BluRay Title Info Screen from the x264 Screen and uncheck every Internal Subtitle for each episode so they will be ignored when making the mkvmerge batch file.

Bugs:
*Corrected a misspelling of a word in an error message displayed to the user
*Corrected a misspelling of a word on the Create x264 Batch File Screen
*Fixed bug where the Create x264 Batch File mkvmerge logic was evaluating Disc.BluRayTitleInfo.EpisodeNumber and not Disc.EpisodeNumber.  The bug only occurs when users pad the Episode Number on the BluRay Title Info Screen with zeroes


add checkbox to ignore internal subs when muxing for encode -done
-create new flag EAC3ToConfiguration.IgnoreInternalSubtitles -done
-MKVMergeOutputService.GetSubtitlePart(), add logic here to check this flag and act accordingly -done
-MKVMergeOutputService.GetTrackOrderPart(), add logic here to check this flag to get the correct count -done
-On eac3to screen, always set this flag to false -done



--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
