--todo
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen

*the blu-ray title info window cannot be closed without specifying the episode number. maybe a bit annoying if you havent looked at that yet and just wanted to have an overview of all the stream tracks.

*after clicking create eac3to batch file the current work table is being closed. this is annoying as well if you want to add stuff after another with a bit of a break in between. it would be nice to have a close button here instead of this window auto-closing.

*it would be nice if the default settings for track demuxing are changeable. e.g. Id always use the dtsma/trueHD lossless stream, so id prefer not having to change this each time from DTS core or AC3. same for chapters, I never use them but they are ticked by default.

--possible nice to haves
*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)
*Unselect all on Blu-ray Title Info Screen
*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav
*On Blu-ray Title Info Screen, instead of auto-sorting by langage, just always put eng at the top
*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
*research mkv merge and how the gui would work
*TheTVDB.com integration
