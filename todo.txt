--1.6 todo
*Added -log paramter to eac3to parameters
*BluRay Disc info object no longer has its own eac3to configuration.  This is global for all discs and the eac3to configuration has been pulled out

*Added a lot more log4net logging and user friendly error messages.  Also created a global error format template
*Users can name eac3to output tracks on the eac3to screen, making it easier to remux them with a tool such as MKVMergeGUI
*eac3to output file name is now in it's own service, which makes unit testing and changes easier
*Fixed bug where eac3to output directory select directory dialog popup had duplicate verbiage in the title
