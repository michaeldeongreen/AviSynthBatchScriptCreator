--1.9 todo
*Created an extension method for the List<BluRayDiscInfo> to get the # of episodes
*Created unit test to support this new functionality
*Created NumberOfEpisodes property on EAC3ToConfiguration Class
*Major bug fixed where you couldn't set the audio type on the Blu-ray Title Info Screen
*Hardcoded 99 batch size removed from EAC3OutputService and EAC3ToOutputNamingService

*Cleaned up EAC3ToOutputNamingService ie hardcoded 99 and tag/year init is repeated several times


*remove "form" from the Blu-ray Title Info Screen title
*Only Series Name and Season# should be required for remuxes
*The word Remux and AVC should be optional and shouldn't be hardcoded in the code
*Make the year on Remux section a string, so users could format it ie (1965)
*On Blu-ray Title Info Screen, change Track Id Header Text to maybe eac3to Track Id

*found out why BluRayDiscInfo.DiscName is set to the this.BluRayPath and not new DirectoryInfo(this.BluRayPath).Name
*find where you have number of files hardcoded to 99 and put the real value in it



--upcoming
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Bug where you can't close title info screen because episode required even though nothing is chosen.  Button works but not the x at the top [couldn't reproduce]
*ability to save/load eac3to batch guy data
