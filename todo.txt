--todo
*Created the EAC3ToCommonRulesValidatorService to centralize common eac3to validation rules that many of the backend services use.  Validation code was duplicated and increased the application's technical debt

*This may be the best time to change from e{0} to episode{0}, quick search showed that it is only in 4 places.  Unit Tests would break, not backwards compatiable.  It needs to be configurable.
-Add new property on eac3config object for this new flag
-New property in eac3config to get either movie or episode string for the folder names, it will be based on the is movie flag.

*Movie Mode 1
eac3to UI
-Add a new checkbox under the Remux Template called "Is this remux for a movie" or something like that
-Make sure to save/load this new checkbox

Title Info UI
-Episode Name disabled
-Episode Number caption will change to Movie Number

Backend
-New property in eac3config to get either movie or episode string for the folder names, it will be based on the is movie flag.
*Create new eac3to write service, it has its own rules
-You can only have 1 Disc selected 
-You can only have 1 Playlist selected
*Create new mkvmerge write service
-You can only have 1 Disc selected 
-You can only have 1 Playlist selected
*New OutputNamingService


*Movie Mode 2 (probably too much work)
eac3to UI
*Each playlist will have its own remux template 
-Add checkbox above series name, Is this remux for movies?
-IsScreenValid, only check if series name is entered if isremux and not for a movie, we will check this on the backend
-dgvBluRaySummary_CellClick, set the current bluraysummaryinfo, already being done in its celldouble-clic


Backend
-Create a new property on BluRaySummaryInfo for EAC3ToRemuxFileNameTemplate

--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen



*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
