--todo
Default audio:
	This will be on the eac3to screen because it per blu-ray

1) checkbox and a dropdown, maybe a button and maybe a audio type too for main and commentary, go ahead with button so user can explicitly state they want the change and maybe prompt if you are overwritting
	*all non-null title info audio defaults will be set
	*when new title info created, set the default

[request]
refering to the last additions of default tracks, would it also be possible to select which tracks (audio & subtitles) should be ticked by default? refering to audio quality and language.

e.g. Id always want to have the english lossless audio track ticked by default when I jump into a playlist (without the -core or ac3 demux option ticked) as well as only the english subtitles (could be further differentiated between forced only or full english if there is a separate track for forced subs). I dont want to have to tick off all other subtitles files for each playlist.

would it be possible to add this?
[/request]




--possible nice to haves
*On the Create x264 Batch File, add functionality load (.batchGuyEac3toSettings), so you can have the eac3to and mkvmerge info to create an mkvmerge batch file
-Either use If statement or create a new abstract class and move all current mkvmerge logic (except video) to a base class and have a remux/none-remux sub class
-Understand that you can re-use 99% of current mkvmerge service functionality, only with ecnoder mux, they supply you the video name, it isn't auto-created
-Enable mkvmerge section on BluRay Title Info Screen all the time
-Allow user to load the (.batchGuyEac3toSettings) on the Create x264 Batch File Screen
-Once (.batchGuyEac3toSettings), add a new drop down column to the grid that has the episode numbers, so they can be matched with the avs/encode name


*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Trimming white spaces from the encode names on the Create x264 Batch File
*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
-http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
