--1.8 todo
*update versions in class libraries
*put link to wiki in the about page somewhere
*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*find where you have number of files hardcoded to 99 and put the real value in it


*Maybe keep track of the Blu-ray folder directory, so you will open up the same directory every time (could cache it in a program.variable)
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat



--upcoming
