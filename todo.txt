*Enhanced parts of the application responsible for displaying and logging errors

Bug Fixes:

--possible nice to haves
*Use async/wait where applicable

*Put video in a grid for mkvmerge editing

*Add External audio

*Think about tackling the multiple vidoes in a single playlist (labyrinth)

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are


*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked


*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen


*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
