Problems:
*Change AllNamesUnique to AllNamesAndYearUnique and check for existence of name/year and you need to update the documentation where it says name is unique


Test Case 1 - For Movie:
-Had 2 selected discs
-Had 2 selected episodes on disc 1
-One of the episodes hadn't been clicked on
-Was still able to create the eac3to and mkvmerge file
Expected: Should have gotten an error saying episode selected but nothing entered.  Probably because titleinfo is null, it is being skipped.  May need a "Give me all checked where titleinfo is null"


--todo
Enhancements:
*Directory Per Episode text has been changed to Directory Per Playlist
*Created the EAC3ToCommonRulesValidatorService to centralize common eac3to validation rules that many of the backend services use.  Validation code was duplicated and increased the application's technical debt
*When the user chooses Directory Per Playlist for encoding or they are not remuxing for a movie, the folder names eac3to will use has been changed from e## to episode##
*When the user chooses Directory Per Playlist for remuxing movies, the folder names eac3to will use is movie##
*Text updated in all BatchGuy Screens to replace "e##" with "episode##"
*Updated Github Wiki screenshots to reflect eac3to extract folder change to "episode##" when the user chooses Directory Per Playlist
*Settings Screen doesn't close when the user selects the save menu item
*Is Remux for Movie Checkbox added to the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
*When users select Is Remux for Movie Checkbox:
-Season Number is disabled on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-User must enter Remux information for each playlist on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-Label text for "Series" name changes to "Movie" name on the Create eac3to Batch File Screen
-eac3to output directory text changes from "episode##" to "movie##"
-Episode Name is disabled on the BluRay Title Info Screen
-Episode Number text is changed to "Movie #" on the BluRay Title Info Screen
*BatchGuy now has the concept of "movie" mode.  When users choose to remux for a movie:
-Each playlist will be treated like a seperate movie
-Each playlist will have their own Remux Template
-When the user extracts the Blu-ray artifacts, if they choose "Directory Per Playlist", each movie will be in a folder called "movie##"
-Movies will not have an episode number or episode name
-Movie name/Year combination must be unqiue
*Removed Directory Type User Control from the Create eac3to Batch File Screen.  This user control was no longer needed once all the other screens started using the *(.batchGuyEac3toSettings) file
*BatchGuy now has over 150 Unit Tests


Notes:
*(.batchGuyEac3toSettings) files created in BatchGuy 4.4 and below cannot be loaded in any BatchGuy Screen when running BatchGuy 5.0.0+
*The user
*Github documentation and Wikis have been updated to reflect the  changes in BatchGuy 5.0.0


Misc
-tell encode tools user of the changes
-submit software to videohelp, submit tutorials for encode, tv remux, movie remx to videohelp

HDB Notes: 
*The significance of version 5.0.0 is that when you specify that you are remuxing movies, each playlist on each Blu-ray disc will be treated like a movie and therefore, will have their own Remux Information.  So if a user has a 2 in 1 Blu-ray or has a bunch of movie Blu-ray discs that they want to remux at one time, they just add all the Blu-ray discs in BatchGuy, enter Remux Information for each playlist, save all the information in case they want to re-load the data at a later time in BatchGuy, create your eac3to batch file and then your mkvmerge batch file.  In BatchGuy 4.4 and below, Blu-ray playlists were all treated like TV Shows, every playlist shared the same Remux Information (which makes sense for TV) and the episode number was mandatory, so when you muxed your finally movie files, you had to manually remove the episode number.


--possible nice to haves
*Maybe start checking to see if batch files exist first, if so delete them before writing to them

*ExtensionMethods.NumberOfEpisodes needs to filter on summary.episodenumber != null as well for cases where isselected by no episode number.  Not changing it now due to not knowing what the effects are

*Default the MKVToolNixGUI Track Name to "Commentary" if commentary checkbox is checked
*When a single file contains multiple episodes :
	1) Go by the actually episode number entered in the loop
	2) Validate on the screen



*Create a batchguy log file that indicates how many files were processed and how long it took
*Make the Season Number on Create eac3to Batch File optional (so movies can be remuxed)


*Rename EnumBluRayLineItemType to have eac3to in the title, to prepare for tsMuxeR OR Make the identifylineitem service generic to pass in any enum or a combo of these
*Research and start laying down the foundation for tsMuxeR
-Understand the cli
-Understand that you have to now introduce mkvmerge cli to mux the .h264 file into an mkv
-Understand that 2 new exes have be tracked, mkvmerge and tsMuxeR
-Understand that you will have to use eac3to for .wav


*maybe add a check all checkbox to grids with is selected
-http://dotnetvisio.blogspot.com/2015/08/create-select-all-checkbox-column.html

*figure out a better solution to inform of the status of long running tasks
*ability to create sample.avs/sample.encode.bat
*Ability to set the video variable for avisynth for advanced scripting
